# WebGUI Community Tutorial

We are building a community tutorial that shows
how to add a WebGUI to RICOH THETA plug-ins.

We are using the tutorial from RICOH's 
[@3215](https://qiita.com/3215) as a base. His tutorial was translated
into English by the community.  Please see the discussion at the link
below to contribute.
