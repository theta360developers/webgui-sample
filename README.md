# Slapshot Camera Tester

This plug-in is used for testing the functionality of the camera in a sports setting. I like ice hockey. I am using a web page to configure and use the camera. This takes advantage of the WebGUI that can be used with RICOH THETA plug-ins.


We are using the tutorial from RICOH's 
[@3215](https://qiita.com/3215) as a base. His tutorial was translated
into English by the community.  Please see the discussion at the link
below to contribute.
